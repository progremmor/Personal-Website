                <p style="line-height:2">This summer, I had an incredible opportunity to attend the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) Frontiers program (a two-week pre-college experience for high school students interested in STEM). In this program, I took their Computer Science course and dove into the world of web development. One of the highlights of the program was learning how to create a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript from the ground up.</p>
                <p><br></p>

                <p style="justify-self: center;"><strong>Why Build a Website from Scratch?</strong></p>
                <p style="line-height:2">We were introduced to the fundamentals of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, starting with basic page structure, gradually adding interactivity, animations, and responsiveness. These three seemingly different languages are able to work together due to their unique functions (<strong>HTML</strong> is used for the layout/structure of the page, <strong>CSS</strong> is fittingly used for styling, and <strong>JavaScript&nbsp;</strong>allows for interactivity and functionality within the webpage).&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="line-height:2">Unlike drag-and-drop visual builders like <strong>Elementor</strong>, coding from scratch gave me complete control over every pixel and interaction. It allowed me to do virtually whatever they want and removed all the restrictions and limitations that came with drag-and-drop visual builders. With no limitations from templates or pre-built components, I realized: <strong>I can build anything</strong>!</p>
                <p style="line-height:2">One of the most rewarding parts? <strong>This very blog page was built using HTML and CSS.</strong> From the layout and styling to the dynamic features, it reflects everything we learned and practiced during the program.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="line-height:2">Of course, writing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has its challenges. It can be time-consuming. Debugging layout issues and scripting dynamic behavior isn&rsquo;t always easy. For example, I spent a lot of time debugging misplaced divs or fixing a CSS rule that didn&rsquo;t behave the way I expected. JavaScript, in particular, can be tricky when dealing with dynamic content or user input. However, with more time and experience, these issues can be quickly avoided.</p>
                <p ><br></p>
                <p style="justify-self: center;"><strong>My Takeaway</strong></p>
                <p style="line-height:2">While tools like Elementor are useful for quick designs, learning to code builds a strong foundation for more advanced web development and understanding modern frameworks like React. With HTML and CSS, the possibilities for website designs are endless. For any student serious about tech, WPI Frontiers is a great place to start.</p>
