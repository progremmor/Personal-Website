            <p style="justify-self: center;font-weight:bold">By Ryan &mdash; Rising Junior | Programmer | Roboticist | Curious Learner
            </p>
            <p style="line-height:2">Hi, I&rsquo;m Ryan, a rising 11th grader at Lexington High School, Massachusetts.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height:2">My passion for technology started early, assembling LEGO robots in elementary
                school. That spark evolved into a deep commitment to competitive VEX robotics, where I&rsquo;ve served
                as a programmer and data analyst for teams 10102Z, 10102A, and 8889A. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve
                qualified for the US Open and VEX World Championship every year, reached the finals at both, and won
                multiple regional and national titles. In the VEX virtual coding skills rankings, I placed 4th globally
                in 2022&ndash;2023 and 6th in 2023&ndash;2024.</p>
            <p style="line-height:2">But robotics is more than competition. It&rsquo;s about community and growth. I
                teach robotics and coding to younger students at summer camps, including kids with learning
                disabilities, and love seeing them grow into confident coders and builders.</p>
            <p style="line-height:2">At the core of all this is my love for coding and computer science. Whether
                I&rsquo;m writing autonomous routines for VEX bots, diving into algorithms and data structures, or
                exploring AI, I find energy in solving problems creatively. I&rsquo;m fluent in several programming
                languages and am always curious to learn more.</p>
            <p style="line-height:2">This blog is my space to share what I&rsquo;m learning and building &mdash; from
                robotics projects to coding experiments to reflections on the tech shaping our future. Let&rsquo;s
                connect, explore, and build something awesome together.</p>
