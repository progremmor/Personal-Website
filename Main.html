                <p>Welcome to My Tech Journey</p>
                <p>By Ryan &mdash; Rising Junior | Programmer | Roboticist | Curious Learner</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Ryan, a rising 11th grader at Lexington High School, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>My passion for technology started early, assembling LEGO robots in elementary school. That</p>
                <p>spark evolved into a deep commitment to competitive VEX robotics, where I&rsquo;ve served as a</p>
                <p>programmer and data analyst for teams 10102Z, 10102A, and 8889A. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve</p>
                <p>qualified for the US Open and VEX World Championship every year, reached the finals at</p>
                <p>both, and won multiple regional and national titles. In the VEX virtual coding skills rankings, I</p>
                <p>placed 4th globally in 2022&ndash;2023 and 6th in 2023&ndash;2024.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>But robotics is more than competition. It&rsquo;s about community and growth. I teach robotics and</p>
                <p>coding to younger students at summer camps, including kids with learning disabilities, and love</p>
                <p>seeing them grow into confident coders and builders.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>At the core of all this is my love for coding and computer science. Whether I&rsquo;m writing</p>
                <p>autonomous routines for VEX bots, diving into algorithms and data structures, or exploring AI, I</p>
                <p>find energy in solving problems creatively. I&rsquo;m fluent in several programming languages and am</p>
                <p>always curious to learn more.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>This blog is my space to share what I&rsquo;m learning and building &mdash; from robotics projects to</p>
                <p>coding experiments to reflections on the tech shaping our future.</p>
                <p>Let&rsquo;s connect, explore, and build something awesome together.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>A Little More About Me:</p>
                <p> Passionate about computer science, robotics, AI, and emerging tech</p>
                <p> Built a bocce court at the Lexington Community Center as my Eagle Scout service project</p>
                <p> Competitive cross-country runner</p>
                <p> Online math tutor for under-resourced students, including those with ADHD and learning disabilities</p>
